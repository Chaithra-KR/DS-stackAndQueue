* Stack is an abstract data type that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.It is a sequential collection collection of
  elements.
* LIFO means the last element that inserted into the stack is first element to be removed from the stack.
* A stack is considered as abstract data type(ADT) because it defines a set of operations and properties without specifying the
  underlying implementation details. The term "abstract" refers to the fact that iss focuses on the specific way it is implemented.


###### A stack typically has two main operations: ######
<br>
Push: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack.
 <br>
Pop: This operation removes the top element from the stack.

###### addition to these basic operations, stacks usually include other auxiliary operations such as: ######
<br>
Peek or Top: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
Size: Returns the number of elements currently in the stack.
IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty or not.

###### Stack applications ######
<br>

* Browsing history tracking

* Undo operation when typing 

* Stacks are useful in evaluating arithmetic expressions, including infix, postfix, and prefix notations. They can be used to convert expressions from one notation to another, or to evaluate the expressions directly. 

* call stack in js runtime

* Stacks are used to manage function calls in programming languages.

* Backtracking algorithms, used in problem-solving and constraint satisfaction, often utilize stacks. The stack stores the current state of the search, allowing for backtracking and exploration of alternative paths when encountering dead ends.
